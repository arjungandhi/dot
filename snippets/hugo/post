# The Blurb

This project was a shot at my childhood dream of making a robot that can walk. Somehow also convinced my school to give me college credit for it. Me and my team designed built and programmed a 12 DOF quadruped over the course of 8 months. Due to some mechanical errors the quadruped was not able to hold up its own weight but this should be easily fixable in future generations of the mechanics.

# What I did

On this project I was primarily responsible for the programming and controls of the robot. I worked on everything from the math on the controls to the high level visualizations of the robots. 

# Features
  - Carbon Fiber and 3d printed body
  - Custom circuit boards for power distribution and wire management
  - Highly expansible code base that runs on a Raspberry pi
  - Code base can easily be modified to work on a completely different quadruped
  - Visualization of the quadruped gaits for debugging for running on a real robot
  - Low latency Websocket comms over Wifi
  - 2 custom GUI's for Motor, and Single Leg testing
  - 3 implemented gaits 
  - High Power BLDC actuators
