## Phase 1. Scoping & Design & Prototyping

The goal of this phase is to understand and define the mass of vibes -> into a plan. Play with some toy examples and get a sense of what this thing will be. Define rought limits to where it should end. 

Some useful questions this phase should answer
1. What will this thing look like
2. Do I actually need / want this
3. How long will this take to do

## Phase 2. Beta

Built out a simple version and start using it with "customers" get feedback. You'll get more clarity as this happens so start to refine and clean up stuff. Here.

## Phase 3. GA

At this point we should have a strong idea of what this needs to look like. Take the time to refine the work, make it clean and something you are proud of

## Phase 4. Finish

Complete the project you can do this in one of a few ways

1. Hand it off to someone who will keep running with it
2. Call it finished. 

In this phase if applicable you *must* share your work. Doing this in silence is no fun.
